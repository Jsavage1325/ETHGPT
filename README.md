# ETHGPT

## The problem

When new developers start using web3 there is a lot of information, and it can be hard to understand what tools to use for specific tasks.

## A tool for onboarding web3 developers with speed and ease, providing easy access to 'experts' and 'tools' in the web3 space.

Leverage the reasoning of LLMs to use a selection of tools and 'experts' to decide on appropriate tools to complete tasks.

The tools can do various things, such as access search engine results, viewsmart contract code on etherscan and send eth using web3.py.

We have also created 'experts' with vector embeddings and semantic search, which allow for a dive into docs.

The LLM will create a chain of events, using it's reasoning to decide on appropriate tools to use or experts to ask to solve problems specified by the user.
